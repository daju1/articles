One body Casimir effect formula for perfectly conducting nano honeycomb is obtained.

Nano honeycomb thrust measuring will prove the existence of virtual quantum photons.

Meso honeycomb thrust should be enough for correction of satellite orbits.

Different shapes of nano honeycombs and their bottoms should give the thrust.

Casimir honeycomb thrust should be observed in both metal and dielectric honeycombs.

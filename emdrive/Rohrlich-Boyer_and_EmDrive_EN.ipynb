    "Hi, shall we talk about 4/3? I mean this discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/daju1/articles/tree/master/4_per_3_problem/references\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next message I'll upload more papers for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Got it! I'm waiting for the next message with additional papers. Ready to continue the discussion of the **4/3 problem** in the context of electromagnetic mass, relativistic covariance, and historical debates between Abraham, Lorentz, Fermi, and Rohrlich.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "In general, we've already had discussions about Fermi's ideas. But we haven't yet talked about the Rohrlich-Boyer controversy. Let's start the analysis with Rohrlich's 1966 paper. Rohrlich proposes a somewhat different way to calculate the field momentum: in addition to the integral of the Poynting vector over space, he also proposes an additional term — the scalar product of velocity with the Maxwell stress tensor. Can you help me understand the justification for this new term in more detail, so to speak in simple terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Of course! Let's analyze **Rohrlich's 1966 paper** (actually his article *\"On Relativistic Theories\"*, Am. J. Phys. 34, 987 (1966)), and especially — **his proposal for a new formula for the electromagnetic field momentum**, which differs from the traditional integral of the Poynting vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Context: What's the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical electrodynamics, the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic field are usually defined through the **Maxwell energy-momentum tensor** $\\Theta^{\\mu\\nu}$. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy density: $u = \\frac{1}{8\\pi}(E^2 + B^2)$\n",
    "- Momentum density (Poynting vector):  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbf{g} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi c} \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the total field momentum:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{em}} = \\int \\mathbf{g} \\, d^3x = \\frac{1}{4\\pi c} \\int \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\, d^3x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**But!** This formula **works correctly only for radiation** — that is, for fields with zero rest mass ($m = 0$), such as plane waves. In these cases, the field is **closed**: $\\partial_\\mu \\Theta^{\\mu\\nu} = 0$, and the integral of $\\Theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ doesn't depend on the choice of integration hypersurface.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for **static or quasi-static fields**, for example, around a moving charged sphere, the situation is different:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The field is **not closed** because there are sources (charges).\n",
    "- The energy-momentum tensor is **not divergence-free**:  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\partial_\\mu \\Theta^{\\mu\\nu} = -f^\\nu \\neq 0,\n",
    "  $$  \n",
    "  where $f^\\nu$ is the Lorentz force density.\n",
    "- Therefore, the integral $\\int \\Theta^{0i} d^3x$ **is not a component of a 4-vector** and **does not transform as momentum** when switching to another inertial frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what leads to the famous **4/3 problem**:\n",
    "- The electromagnetic rest energy of a sphere: $U = \\frac{e^2}{2a}$\n",
    "- If we calculate mass as $m = U/c^2$, then the momentum during motion should be $\\mathbf{P} = \\gamma m \\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "- But if we calculate momentum as $\\int \\mathbf{g} d^3x$, we get $\\mathbf{P} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{U}{c^2} \\mathbf{v}$ — hence the \"4/3\".\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What does Rohrlich propose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rohrlich argues: **if you want the electromagnetic field momentum to be part of a 4-vector**, then it must be defined **not simply as an integral of $\\Theta^{0i}$**, but **as an integral over a hypersurface connected to the rest frame**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his approach (see Rohrlich 1970, but the idea was already present in 1966):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The total 4-momentum of the system is defined as  \n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> P^\\mu = \\int \\Theta^{\\mu\\nu} n_\\nu \\, d^3\\sigma,\n",
    "> $$  \n",
    "> where $n_\\nu$ is the normal to the integration hypersurface.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system with rest mass $m > 0$ (e.g., a charged sphere), **the hypersurface must be \"comoving\"** — that is, it must be a spatial section in the rest frame, transformed to the moving system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the system where the sphere moves with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, the normal to this hypersurface is the **4-velocity** $v^\\mu = (\\gamma, \\gamma \\mathbf{v})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the 4-momentum density of the field:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{P}^\\mu = \\Theta^{\\mu\\nu} v_\\nu\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's decompose this:\n",

    "### 🔹 In simple terms: why add $\\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a charged sphere that is **moving**. Around it there's an electric field, and due to the motion, a magnetic field arises. But the field is **deformed**: it's \"squashed\" in the direction of motion (relativistic contraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Poynting vector $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ describes the **local energy flux**, but **doesn't account for mechanical stress** in the field.\n",
    "- The stress tensor $\\mathbf{T}$ describes **how the field is \"stressed\"** — as if there were internal forces (tension along field lines, pressure perpendicular to them).\n",
    "- When the system moves, these **internal stresses begin to \"contribute\" to momentum**, because they are carried along with the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analogy: if you carry a stretched spring, its momentum is not just the momentum of the mass, but also a contribution from internal stress. In relativistic theory, **everything that carries energy or stress contributes to momentum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **$\\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$** is precisely the **contribution from \"stress transport\"** during motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this term, you're calculating momentum **at a fixed moment of time in the lab frame**, but **this doesn't correspond to a 4-vector**, because at different points of the field, \"simultaneity\" in the rest frame is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Why does this solve the 4/3 problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you substitute $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ of a moving charged sphere into the formula  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{em}} = \\gamma \\int \\left( \\mathbf{g} + \\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\right) d^3x_0,\n",
    "$$  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{em}} = \\gamma \\frac{U}{c^2} \\mathbf{v},\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "that is, **without the 4/3**! Because now momentum and energy form **a single 4-vector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 But then why does Boyer object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boyer says: **\"Wait! In a real physical process (e.g., assembling an electron), the field momentum is indeed equal to $\\frac{4}{3} \\frac{U}{c^2} \\mathbf{v}$, and this is not an error — it reflects the fact that the field interacts with external forces (Poincaré stresses)\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Boyer:\n",
    "- The field momentum **doesn't have to** be part of a 4-vector by itself.\n",
    "- Only the **total momentum of the system** (field + mechanical stabilizing forces) must be a 4-vector.\n",
    "- And Rohrlich **artificially redefines** the field momentum so that it \"looks covariant\", but loses the physical connection with real forces and fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is:\n",
    "- **Rohrlich**: \"Let's divide the system so that the electromagnetic part is covariant by itself\".\n",
    "- **Boyer**: \"No, the division is conditional; physically the field and stabilizing forces are connected, and only their sum is covariant\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Rohrlich adds $\\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. He wants the **electromagnetic momentum by itself** to transform as a 4-vector.\n",
    "2. This is achieved by integrating over a **comoving hypersurface**, not over $t = \\text{const}$.\n",
    "3. Mathematically, this is equivalent to adding $\\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ to the momentum density.\n",
    "4. This **eliminates the 4/3**, but at the cost of **redefining what we call \"field momentum\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an error — it's a **different concept of dividing the total energy-momentum into parts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to further explain how this relates to **non-local volume** $d^3x_0$ and why it's important?"

In the context of the **Rohrlich–Boyer discussion** and the whole **4/3 problem**, the question of the **ponderomotive force** (that is, the force acting on matter from the electromagnetic field) turns out to be **key**, because it's precisely through it that the interaction of field and matter manifests — especially when it comes to **stabilizing a charged body** (for example, a classical electron).\n",

    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Excellent and deep question! At first glance, **S. B. Karavashkin's** work on EmDrive and the **Rohrlich–Boyer** discussion about the 4/3 problem and field momentum definition lie in different planes:  \n",
    "- **Karavashkin** — in applied engineering physics, with emphasis on **local induced currents**, phase shifts, and **macroscopic forces** in a resonator.  \n",
    "- **Rohrlich–Boyer** — in theoretical relativistic electrodynamics, with emphasis on **global covariance**, 4-momentum definition, and the role of **non-local effects** (e.g., relativistic non-simultaneity).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **there is a connection** — and it manifests at the **conceptual level**, especially in **how to understand field-matter interaction** and **what to consider \"real\" momentum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. Common theme: **the field is not isolated from matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Boyer and Karavashkin emphasize the same physical truth:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The electromagnetic field cannot be considered separately from the sources and the medium it interacts with.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Boyer**: the field around a charged sphere is **not closed** (∂ₙΘᵐⁿ ≠ 0), and its momentum **is not conserved by itself** — it exchanges momentum with **external (Poincaré) forces**, especially when moving to a moving frame.  \n",
    "- For **Karavashkin**: the field in a resonator **doesn't simply reflect**, but **induces currents** in the walls, and the **direction and phase of these currents** (in copper vs ferrite) determine the resulting force. That is, **field momentum is transferred to matter**, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches **reject the idea of \"purely field\" momentum** existing independently of matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. The role of **phase and non-simultaneity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Boyer**, the key point is **relativistic non-simultaneity**: in a moving frame, stabilizing forces are applied **at different times** to different parts of the sphere → a **net momentum** appears, transferred to matter. This is a **non-local effect**.\n",
    "- For **Karavashkin** — also a **phase shift**, but **local**: in copper, eddy currents are anti-phase to the field; in ferrite — in-phase. This creates an **asymmetry in local Ampère forces**, leading to **net momentum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the scales are different (relativistic kinematics vs classical induction), **the logic is similar**:  \n",
    "> **Symmetry is broken not in the field, but in its interaction with matter**, and this is what generates the observable effect.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Boyer** insists: **momentum is conserved**, but only **in the complete system** (field + stabilizing forces). The \"extra\" 1/3 — is **not an error**, but **reflects momentum exchange**.\n",
    "- **Karavashkin** claims: **EmDrive doesn't violate conservation laws**, because **field and walls are a single system**, and **momentum is transferred through local Ampère forces**, not \"from nothing\".\n",

    "- In EmDrive **there is no static Coulomb field**, no 4/3 problem, no relativistic velocities.  \n",

    "\n",
    "But **the spirit of the approach** is **anti-Rohrlich**:  \n",

    "> Instead, **account for all interaction** — and then conservation will work **naturally**.\n",

    "---\n",

    "### 🔹 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes, there is a connection — but not technical, rather methodological and philosophical.**\n",

    "- Both **Boyer** and **Karavashkin** advocate for a **physically motivated**, **locally grounded** understanding of field-matter interaction.\n",

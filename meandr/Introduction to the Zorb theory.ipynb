In the case of accelerated motion the potential must be counted from retarded position, where the acceleration stress was appeared from charge. But in contrary to Maxwell’s theory with LW potentials, stress spread from charge in the “medium” of scalar potential field moving with charge and deformed by acceleration. This task more difficult then stresses in air infront the piston moving in the tube or infront bullet in a gun barrel. I solve this problem by simplification.   Fortunately, the Lienard and Wiechert retarding method is flexible to varies of light speed. Let the charge start movement with speed v from observer O in time t=0. At the time t in observer’s clock the retarded time is tr= t/(1+v/c) and retarded distance rr=vtr=vt/(1+v/c)<vt=r, if counted for well-known c.  “Projected” distance for LW potential is rr(1+v/c)=vt=r, and LW potential is q/r.\n",

    "    6. Main peculiarities of Zorb theory  .\n",
    "\n",
    "Unmoving charges interacts by Coulomb force between themselves in Zorb theory, as in Maxwell’s. The Ampere force  is ordinary between closed current circuits in Zorb theory too, as a force act to current in the magnetic field of other current . But a small electric force appears from current circuit proportional to v2/c2 magnitude of moving charges speed there. This force negligible for currents in ordinary conductors with Ohm resistance because low speed of charges there. But this force may be detected in the superconductive coil. This kind of electrostatic induction from superconductive coil was find in experiments of Edvards and Lemon [8], [9], repeated by Shishkin [10] and Mende [11]. This may be a reason of LHC accident in 2008 also, when  the superconductive coil was damaged.\n",
    "The Faraday’s electromagnet induction is obtained in Zorb theory too, according to equation (10):\n",
    ".\n",
    "At the other way, beside of known theory formalism, in Zorb theory electromotive force of induction appear as a direct action of changed moving potential field momentum  A=vφ/c2, may existed even where field B absent (rotA=0). For example, the magnetic field B concentrated inside the transformer core and not exist beside it (in ideal case at least). But the electromotive force inducted in second coil by the current in primary coil, even if they placed independent one from other, despite of field B absent there, concentrated inside the core. Thus B=rotA=0 continuously in the second coil region, hence rotE=-dB/dt =0 also in this volume, but E=-dA/dt not zero there. This is proof the direct action of moving potential field momentum  A even without field B necessary. This has place in known Aharonov and Bom quantum effect also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Known electromagnetic waves (radiation) are in Zorb theory too, although they counting by the known Lienard retarding at this work, see the last term in eq. (27). This is acceptable in far waves zone when the source of waves is unmoving in the observers frame.  More proper retarding waves in the moving and deformated field of scalar potential will be investigate in the next works. But even in this work is a reason to admit that known transverse EM waves with energy flux expressed by Pointing vector P=[ExB] may bin expressed as transverse waves of changing scalar potential field momentum –dA/dt=aφ/c2 . Retarded acceleration of source charges a has the constant magnitude at the distant, potential φ reduced as 1/r, thus the waves has magnitude reduced as 1/r also. In this way the EM waves explained as the transverse “elastic” waves of the scalar potential field medium, which rotor not a zero and thus made a field B. Even more exotic explanation of radiated waves may be done as longitudinal waves of kinetic potential ψ=φv2/2c2, as the waves of energy flux in the scalar potential field medium. But it is important that waves of changing scalar potential field momentum –dA/dt=aφ/c2 are longitudinal also in direction of movement and acceleration of source charges, and compensate waves of kinetic potential ψ in this direct. Therefore the potential waves are effective only in transverse direction of acceleration movement of source charges, as ordinary.\n",
    "\n",
    " Other peculiarities of Zorb theory are seen in cases of moving charged particles interactions, as in the Trouton and Noble experiment. It is known problem in this experiment explored, that if two charges  rigid connected (two charges on the rod ends, or charges in condenser) are in motion, a force torque proportional to (v/c)2Sin2α must appear, α is the angle between the velocity and the rod or the normal of the condenser plate, as the charge moving in the magnetic field of its neighbor. But it is not detected. The SRT explain this fact as \"hidden\" forces torque action from the stick or condenser body (by tensor of energy and momentum). The Zorb theory explain this fact, at the one way, by eccentric electric forces E, see equations (17) and (27) above, term \n",
    "\t.\n",
    "From the other way, the fields of scalar potential move with charges according Zorb theory, therefore one charge is no moving relative to other and there are no additional forces in this system apart of central Coulomb forces, thus torque is absent. In this way Zorb theory is similar to Weber theory of direct action, although differ at the better way by accounting of retarding and eccentric electric forces achieved by vector potential A, thus EM transverse waves radiation are obtained in proper direction. Therefore it is interesting to compare Webers and Zorb theories more completely. \n",

On fig.9 are graphics of Weber’s “field” of charge moving uniformly with speed 0.5, 0.8 and 0.98 of light speed c. We see that magnitude of “field” is the same us field in Zorb theory on fig.4 at the same speed. But directions of streamlines are differ in both cases, because Weber’s force is centric, as the Maxwell’s. Therefore this divergence violate of Gauss theorem (conservation of charge law) more significant in Weber’s then in Zorb theory , it is 12% at the speed 0.5 c, 32% at 0.8 c, and 50% at 0.98 c (compare with 4% at 0.5 c, 10% at 0.8 c, and 16% at the 0.98 c in Zorb theory). From the other side, the divergence of the Weber’s “field” E is zero in volume beside charges if it is in uniformly motion , contrary in Zorb theory it is not zero, force field E of moving scalar potential seems as “selfcharged”.\n",
    "If the charge accelerated, the Weber’s force field is not symmetric, the force increase backward to acceleration, see fig.10 (note that term in Eq.(38)), and divergence beside of charge not a zero (positive forward and negative backward) .  Thus the Weber’s theory explains the Faradays induction thanks to this asymmetric property only, without retarding (but by violate conservation of charge law in it Gauss theorem form). Note the region backward of charge were force streamline direct inverse (contrary to brake acceleration). The similar region of inverse force is in Zorb theory in accelerated case  (fig.6).  EM waves radiation are not obtained generally without retarding, and this is main flaw the Weber’s origin theory in his idea of instant action on distance at least. \n",

Feynman illustrate by this example namely the violation of third Newton’s law in Maxwell’s theory ([4], part 26, § 2) because the electric field E2 only act on the first charge from the second (B2=0 there), but the  second charge move in magnetic field of the first charge, thus the addition Lorenz force FL=V2 x B1  act on it. Therefore the uncompensated forces F12 and F21 and uncompensated angular momentum of forces appear in this case, fig.11 a). In Weber’s theory forces W21 and W21 are compensated between the charges, and uncompensated angular momentum of forces not appears generally because forces are central, fig 11.b). \n",
    "In Zorb theory this charges act one to other by potentials forces Q12 and Q21 firstly (gradients of the spherical potential fields ϕ=φ+ψ (3)) , and by changing relative momentum of electricity movement –dA12/dt and  –dA21/dt secondary . It is important that relative momentum of electricity movement A12 and A21 are not same as A1 = v1φ1 and A2 = v2φ2  (that momentum in  coordinates frame choused  take place), but relative one charge to other mutually:\n",
    ";\t\t.\t\t(40)\n",
    "As charges move uniformly, fields of scalar potentials are spherical “shells” moving with charges (dashed curves in fig.11 c)), and the time derivatives of A is gradient φ in direction of relative speed  :\n",
    "; \tand reversely: .\t\t(41)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore forces  F12 and F21 are equal and contrary one to other, but they not gone on one line, they gone two parallel lines, create angular momentum of forces. This angular momentum of forces is similar to Maxwell’s theory, but forces end momentum are compensated in Zorb theory, contrary to Maxwell’s. Such angular momentum is absent in Weber’s theory, and it investigators approve that as its advantage. Hence it is a question, is this angular momentum the drawback of theories or advantage really ? As I know, the angular momentum of electricity confirmed by experiments, in particular by experiment of G.M.  Graham,  D.G.  Lahoz [16]. \n",
    "There is no involve the action of magnetic field B in this example in Zorb theory. But this is not mean that magnetic field B not involve generally. I think that must be combined involve of “microforce” –dAij/dt between separate particles as was above,  and “macroforce” [vxB] of movement in the magnetic field B from closed current circuits and permanent magnets as  macrosources. Note that Maxwell assumed the same combined equation in his “Treaty” for “electromotive force” in §599:\n",

    "If the answer to questions about kinetic divergence above will be decided at favor of effective charge grows of half quadric velocity (1+v2/2c2) it may assume the next considerations. Light negative charged particles move faster then heavy slow positive, thus neutral bodies (with equal quantity of positive and negative charges) must interact mutually with forces below:\n",

    "9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions were considered in this work vary important for alternative theories:\n",
    "-\t about meaning electromagnet field as number of  primary fields of scalar potential of charged particles;\n",
    "    • about wide meaning of charge conservation law and Gauss theorem;\n",
    "    • about changes of known Maxwell’s equations and the theory generally;\n",
    "    • about wide meaning of conservation momentum and angular momentum.\n",
    "The question not considered properly is about new (or very old ?) meaning of electricity momentum as  and therefore change meaning of energy flux as Pointing vector only.\n",
    "All this questions deal with any alternative theory, as Weber’s and others, not with proposed Zorb theory only.\n",
    "As my mind, the Zorb theory most similar to theory of Carl Neumann [7], [15] with potentials “shells” moving linked with its source (charges carried its own potential fields). It’s just easy calculate field and force when charge move uniformly, it appears as absence of retarding. The acceleration must deform the initial spherical field of scalar potential at retarding manner evidently, but it is not known as namely and how to calculate the movement of such field properly, spatially with varieties of propagation speed c.  Unfortunately, there are not any known important investigations of this idea at last 150 years. My attempt is not well enough here also, but may be other investigators make it  better in future. \n",

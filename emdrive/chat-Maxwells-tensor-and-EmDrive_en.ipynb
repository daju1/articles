    "## 🔹 2. Why the First Formula Is Also \"Correct\" — and When\n",
    "\n",
    "First formula:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p_Ht_right_conductor = (Hy².real + Hy².imag) / (2*8π)\n",
    "```\n",
    "— this is the **averaged magnetic field pressure on the boundary**, calculated as **difference of Maxwell tensors**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_H = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\left( \\frac{|\\mathbf{B}_1|^2}{\\mu_1} - \\frac{|\\mathbf{B}_2|^2}{\\mu_2} \\right) \\cos\\theta \\quad\\text{(general case)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "or for vacuum/conductor:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_H = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} |\\mathbf{H}_{\\parallel}|^2 \\quad (\\mu = 1 \\text{ in vacuum}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which is **not force on currents**, but **force on the surface** as a result of **field stresses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula **doesn't include µ**, because it expresses the **difference of field pressures**, not the **microscopic force on charges**. It assumes that **all the field is external**, and **magnetization is already accounted for in boundary conditions** through the discontinuity of $ \\mathbf{B}_\\perp $, $ \\mathbf{H}_\\parallel $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. Where Does the Reaction Force Come From? Or: Where Does Momentum Go?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **key question**, and it fully aligns with your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Yes, the reaction force exists — and it's applied **to the magnetization itself** (to magnetic dipoles, to domains, to spins).\n",
    "\n",
    "In macroscopic electrodynamics this is formalized through the **stress tensor in the magnetic subsystem**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{mag}} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{\\text{mag}}, \\quad \\mathbf{T}_{\\text{mag}} = -\\mathbf{M} \\otimes \\mathbf{H}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then total force on volume element:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{total}} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{c} \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{B}}_{\\text{on currents}} + \\underbrace{(\\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{H}}_{\\text{on dipoles}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use **only** $ \\frac{1}{c} \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mu \\mathbf{H} $, you're **not accounting for force on magnetization**, meaning — **you break momentum balance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 4. Example: Homopolar Motor\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider your example — **Faraday's homopolar motor**:\n",
    "- cylindrical magnet, $ \\mathbf{M} = M_0 \\hat{z} $,\n",
    "- current from center to edge: $ \\mathbf{j} = j_r \\hat{r} $,\n",
    "- field inside: $ \\mathbf{B} \\approx B_0 \\hat{z} $, $ \\mathbf{H} = B_0/\\mu - 4\\pi M_0 $ — **inside the magnet $ H $ is opposite to $ B $!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Lorentz force on current:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{c} \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{c} j_r B_0 \\hat{\\phi} \\quad \\text{(rotates the disk)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reaction force** — is the **action of current on magnetic dipoles**:\n",
    "- by Newton's third law, torque on disk = **minus torque on magnetization**,\n",
    "- if magnet is rigidly fixed — torque is transmitted through **mechanical stresses in the lattice** (Poincaré stresses!),\n",
    "- if magnet is free — it **rotates in the opposite direction** (this has been verified experimentally!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "➡️ **Yes**, force on current includes $ \\mu H $,\n",
    "➡️ **But** reaction force acts **on the magnetic subsystem**, and **total momentum is conserved** only if you account for **both currents and dipoles**.\n",

    "## 🔹 5. What to Do in Your MenDrive Calculation?\n",
    "\n",
    "You're modeling an **open system**: resonator + fields in vacuum. Walls are **not infinitely rigid \"ideal conductors\"**, but **real materials with µ ≠ 1**, possibly — ferrites.\n",

    "| **Microscopic force on eddy currents inside the wall** — e.g., for accounting dissipation, heating, local acceleration | ✅ **Second formula**, **but only if you also include force on magnetization** $ (\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{H} $ and verify momentum balance |\n",

    "— and this is **correct**, because they **automatically guarantee momentum balance**, if fields satisfy Maxwell's equations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> ✅ **First formula — is correct in your context.**\n",
    "> ❌ Second formula — **is incomplete**, if you don't add force on magnetization.\n",

    "- All these 4 terms **together** correspond to full divergence:\n",

    "## 🔹 Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep the first formula** for $ p_H $ — it's correct within your approach.\n",
    "2. **Make sure you include all 4 terms** (your code does this — excellent!):\n",
    "   - $ p_E $, $ p_H $, $ t_D $, $ t_B $.\n",
    "3. **For ferrites use complex $\\mu'$** — and phase $\\phi$ will enter **automatically** through $ |H|^2 = H H^* $.\n",
    "4. If you want to **microscopically** account for spin contribution — introduce the LLG equation and add force\n",

    "   \\mathbf{f}_{\\text{spin}} = (\\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{H}\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want — I can **modify your Jupyter** to show how phase $\\phi$ appears in the full sum $ p_E + p_H + t_D + t_B $, and how this agrees with `skin_force_phi.ipynb`.\n",
